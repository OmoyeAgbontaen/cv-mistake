        <p><em><strong>Campus Missionary</strong> with <a href="https://www.everynation.org/">Every Nation</a></em></<p>
        <p>I am a 2nd generation Nigerian American, born and raised in Houston,Tx.
          I gradutaed from the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">Univeristy of Texas at Austin</a> with a
          BS in Medical Laboratory Science in 2012. Shortly after graduated I worked
          as an intern campus Missionary partime and as a Laboratory Scientist
          part-time at <a href="https://www.cpllabs.com/">Cinical Pathology Laboratories</a>. Less than a year later I went
          full time as a campus missionary with Every Nation since then. I enjoy
          hanging out with friends and family, playing volleyball and I've recently
          taken an interest into software development. </p></td>
